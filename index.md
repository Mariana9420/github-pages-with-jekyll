# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about ...

Learn by doing.

What is it? The best way to learn everithing you want: programming, singing, to play a musical instrument. It is the way you taught yourself to achieve a skill. In the learn by doing system you are free to learn wha you want, when you want. It's harder tough, of course, because you've got you and only your motivation to learn. You must search tha materials, choose the info you read, and then you must practice, practice and practice. You've not got a teacher; you are your teacher.
Learn by doing doesn't mean to be compleatly alone. You could find along your amazing way of learning coworkers, mates, friends who wish to master the same skill you want. It becomes easier and funny: you got help and can help others too.
Learn by doing is a way to live.
